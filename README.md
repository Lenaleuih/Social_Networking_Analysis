# Social Network Analysis

Social network anlaysis has found utility is institutional, classroom and analyses of networked data in socially-based educational games. However, the utility of the method largely rests on being able to ascribe meaning to the **structure of the network**. 

This project we'll generate and analyze three social networks (also known as graphs or sociograms) based on three different measures. we will be using data from:

Representing Classroom Social Structure. Melbourne: Victoria Institute of
Secondary Education, M. Vickers and S. Chan, (1981)

Available from the Index of Complex Networks ([ICON](https://icon.colorado.edu/#!/))

Without meaningful interpretation of structure there is no added value to a networked model, you will find more suvccess simply regressing your outcome against student characteristics.  Understanding measures of centrality and network structure in SNA are therefore an important, though difficult, aspect of the method. As with all SNA work, the vocabulary can be daunting though the ideas are relatively intuitive.

## how does it work

* generate a basic sociogram
* apply and interpret a range of centrality measures to a network
* apply and interpret a range of clustering procedures to a network

## use case and application
This project builds several social network diagrams (graphs/sociograms) of a school classroom and then analyzing both centrality measures and clusters within the network.
